### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Austin Hunt

## I currently work with 
- Puppet & Hiera for automating configuration management across a variety of environments, compliance levels, and cloud service providers 
- Docker for app and workflow containerization, learning new tools like Puppet on new Apple Silicon chips that hate virtual machines
- Apache/Nginx/Django/DRF/React/Node/Express/HTML/CSS/Velocity/JavaScript/PHP/WordPress for web and API development projects and CMS management
- Freelance plugin and theme development for Wordpress
- GitHub Actions and GitLab Pipelines for continuous integration and delivery workflows
- OpenAI embeddings and chat completion API for AI integration into web applications like [https://studyrocket.ai](https://studyrocket.ai) and [https://novabrains.ai](https://novabrains.ai)
- Google Gemini APIs for building mobile apps with Expo that support AI-driven conversion of images to text (easy selling of household items for spring cleaning)


## I am currently learning 
- Puppet, Ruby, Hieradata, Confluence & Jira
- How to slow down & soak in some sunshine 
- How to replace an Oxygen sensor on a 1999 Jeep Wrangler
- How to live, laugh, love consistently
- How to leverage the OpenAI API for embeddings and chat completions in a standardized way that fuses with clean front-end functionality like AI assistants and search


## Development Activity 
This little visual is an incomplete view of my development work. It does not include my private repository contributions (a majority) or my contributions to enterprise github projects for work.

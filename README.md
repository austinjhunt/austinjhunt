### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Austin Hunt

## I currently work with 
- Puppet & Hiera for automating configuration management across a variety of environments, compliance levels, and cloud service providers 
- Python, JS, HTML/CSS, PHP, Velocity, PowerShell, Bash
- Django & Django REST Framework (DRF) for custom backend web app and REST API development
- Docker for application containerization, K8s for orchestrating said containers
- Apache and Nginx as primary web servers for enterprise websites and web apps
- React for quick, component-based front end development
- AWS - Elastic Beanstalk, Route53, S3, SSM Parameter Store (to avoid environment variable limitations of EBS environments), API Gateway, Lambda, Cloudwatch with *chef's kiss* JSON logging
- Cloudflare, primarily because it's easy to use and provides some nice security features
- Wordpress (freelance plugin and theme development)
- Linode for hosting
- GitHub Actions with PR labeling to trigger deployments to prod and preview environments and save TONS of time
- OpenAI embeddings and chat completion API for AI integration into web applications like [https://studyrocket.ai](https://studyrocket.ai) and [https://novabrains.ai](https://novabrains.ai)


## I am currently learning 
- Puppet, Ruby, Hieradata, Confluence & Jira
- How to slow down & soak in some sunshine 
- How to replace an Oxygen sensor on a 1999 Jeep Wrangler
- How to live, laugh, love consistently
- How to leverage the OpenAI API for embeddings and chat completions in a standardized way that fuses with clean front-end functionality like AI assistants and search


## Development Activity 
This little visual is an incomplete view of my development work. It does not include my private repository contributions (a majority) or my contributions to enterprise github projects for work.

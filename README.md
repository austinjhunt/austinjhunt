### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Austin Hunt

## I currently work with 

- Python, JS, HTML/CSS, PHP, Velocity, PowerShell, Bash
- Django & Django REST Framework (DRF) for custom backend web app and REST API development
- Docker for application containerization, K8s for orchestrating said containers
- NodeJS
- Network monitoring and alerting:
    - Icinga 2 for monitoring thousands of services across hundreds of network hosts
    - NCPA as the primary monitoring agent  
    - Icinga Web as the web GUI for viewing and managing the network monitoring
    - Icinga Director as an Icinga Web Plugin for easily managing network infrastructure and monitoring targets in the GUI without dealing with server configuration files
    - Ansible for distributed Icinga server management (5+ servers)
    - InfluxDB v2 and Flux for time series monitoring data collection and querying
    - Django for a custom "host manager" app to allow app, web and db administrators to add and remove hosts that their team is responsible for, and specify what needs to be monitored in a distributed manner
    - MySQL for storage of monitoring configuration
    - Netbox for storing and importing network hardware as hosts to monitor
    - Grafana for building visuals of monitoring data
- Apache and Nginx as primary web servers for enterprise websites and web apps
- React for quick, component-based front end development
- AWS - Elastic Beanstalk, Route53, S3, SSM Parameter Store (to avoid environment variable limitations of EBS environments), API Gateway, Lambda, Cloudwatch with *chef's kiss* JSON logging
- Cloudflare, primarily because it's easy to use and provides some nice security features
- Wordpress (freelance plugin and theme development)
- Linode for hosting
- GitHub Actions with PR labeling to trigger deployments to prod and preview environments and save TONS of time
- OpenAI embeddings and chat completion API for AI integration into web applications like [https://studyrocket.ai](https://studyrocket.ai) and [https://novabrains.ai](https://novabrains.ai)


## I am currently learning 
- How to slow down my excitement for development to critically analyze the purpose of projects before diving headfirst
- How to properly architect Icinga, Icinga Director, and Icinga web for optimal performance, coverage, and process efficiency for an enterprise IT team
- How to leverage GitHub Actions to fully automate deployments of prod and preview environments to AWS EBS in a secure and cost-efficient way with custom domains
- How to design clean, intuitive UIs with Material UI
- How to deadlift without hurting myself
- How to manage states and API calls and responses performatively in React
- How to create paid applications with tiered subscription models that leverage Stripe for secure payment processing
- How to build extensions for Ellucian Experience in higher education
- How to live, laugh, love consistently
- How to leverage the OpenAI API for embeddings and chat completions in a standardized way that fuses with clean front-end functionality like AI assistants and search
